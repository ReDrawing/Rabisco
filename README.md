# Processing_KinectV2_SkeletonTools

This repository contains Processing Classes and Methods to preprocess KinectV2 Skeleton Data. 

Dependencies: 
  1) "Kinect v2 for Processing" library - v0.7.8, by Thomas Sanchez Lengeling, found inside the Processing repository (IDE -> sketch -> import library);
  2) "oscP5" library - v0.9.9, by Andreas Schlegel, found inside the Processing repository (IDE -> sketch -> import library);
  3) "Jama" library - v1.0.3, included at this repository, and found at: https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/;

Library features:
  1) Interface with KinectV2 using "Kinect v2 for Processing" library;
  2) Smooth skeleton;
  3) Calibrate for the floor position;
  4) Extract body features;
  5) Send features through network via OSC, using "oscP5" library;

Smoothing algorithm:
  There is a physical model of the skeleton containing the connection strucure of the human body, shown at the image below. This model tries to implement temporal coherence over the skeleton movement, by keeping track of each joint linear velocity, bone angular velocity and bone length.

  The algorithm updates this physical model over time. Each new measurement of the sensor receives a confidence factor based on its "trackingState" information (from Kinect). This confidence factor sets how much this new measurement will get considered in the new estimated position.
  Getting in more detail: The human body Center of Mass is right on the "spineMid" joint, so the smoothing altorithm starts updating from this joint. It predicts the currentEstimatedPosition based on the previousEstimatedPosition, estimatedVelocity and currentMeasurement. Next step is to update its adjacent bones: estimate the boneLength and its orientation based on the previousEstimatedOrientation, angular velocity and current measurement. With these information, the next joint (at the other end of the bone) can be estimated. Each joints calls the next bone to be updated and each bone calls the next joint to be updated. This cycle repeats until the skeleton is fully estimated. 

Floor calibration algorithm:
  Due to possible physical limitations of the environment, the Kinect sensor might be placed on different position/orientation each time it is used. A robust system would have to compensate for this variation. The proposed method is to calibrate the floor position and orientation before using the sensor, so that all the features can be calculated in relation to this new coordinate system. The calibration process goes as follows:
  Stand up in front of the sensor until your skeleton is tracked. Clap your hand to get a snapshot. Walk to a new spot, and clap your hand again. Repeat until there is enough data points. The estimated floor plane will be the plane that best fits the position of your feet during the snapshots. The floor coordinate system will be placed at the mean position of these snapshots.
